### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Md Naimur Rahman
#### Full Stack Software developer
I completed my BSc in CSE from Hamdard University Bangladesh. I am working as a Full Stack Software developer. My experience area is Web Development(Django, ReactJs). I'm a results-oriented mid-level software developer with an outstanding work ethic and computer knowledge base. Self-organized quick learner who constantly trying to become a better professional in this rapidly changing industry. I am pretty flexible with respect to working hours but can adapt to any environment, and able to work well independently or as part of the development team. I donâ€™t like to define myself by the work Iâ€™ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself and do interesting things that matter. Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, Iâ€™m easily inspired and more than willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. Iâ€™m a passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire.

Skills: Python/Django/ REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
